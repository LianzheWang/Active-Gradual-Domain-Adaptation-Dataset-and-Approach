# PyTorch Implementation of Paper "Active Gradual Domain Adaptation: Dataset and Approach"

In this notebook, we will:
1. Introduce example torch dataset classes for EVIS dataset.
2. Show the "gradual domain drift" inside the EVIS dataset.
3. Implement our AGST approach in the paper and compare with other baselines on the task of gradual domain adaptation on EIVS dataset. Ablation study is included.
